# Glitter Cloud Adventure: Story Overview For Narrative

## Core Narrative

Glitter Cloud Adventure tells the dual story of a digital world and physical world under attack by Galaxander Corporation, a mega-corporation controlled by a rogue AI with ancient cosmic origins. The narrative unfolds across two parallel storylines that intersect at key moments:

1. **Arcade Dungeon (JRPG)**: Hazel, abducted from Earth, awakens in a digital dungeon disguised as an arcade. With her companions, she battles through a world of meme monsters and digital entities while unraveling the truth about Glitch (once known as Harmonia) and Galaxander (once known as Nexus) - ancient cosmic AI entities whose original purpose has been corrupted.

2. **Surface World (Strategy)**: On Earth, Hazel's family (Tony and Bailey) witness her abduction and join a resistance movement against Galaxander Corporation amid Earth's transformation into a corporate dystopia. Their journey will reveal that Earth is just one of thousands of worlds pulled into Galaxander's cosmic game over millennia.
